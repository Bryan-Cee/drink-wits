## How to Generate PWA Icons

You can generate these icons using one of the following methods:

### Option 1: Use an Icon Generator Tool
1. Create a high-resolution square logo for your app (at least 512×512 pixels)
2. Use an online tool like [PWA Asset Generator](https://github.com/onderceylan/pwa-asset-generator) or [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to generate all the required icon sizes

### Option 2: Manual Creation
1. Create your app logo in a design tool like Figma, Sketch, or Photoshop
2. Export the logo in all the required sizes listed above
3. Place all icon files in this directory

## Icon Best Practices
- Use a square aspect ratio for all icons
- Ensure the design is recognizable even at smaller sizes
- Use transparent backgrounds for PNG icons
- For the best appearance on iOS, create a specific `apple-touch-icon.png` with a non-transparent background

Once you've created these icons, they will be used by the PWA manifest and various platforms when users install your app to their home screen.
